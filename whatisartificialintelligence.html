<h1>What is Atificial Intelligence (AI)?</h1>

<br>Artificial intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are customized to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to any machine that shows characteristics related with a human brain such as learning and problem-solving.</br>

<br>The perfect characteristic of artificial intelligence is its ability to rationalize and take actions that have the most excellent chance of accomplishing a particular goal.</br>

<h2>Understanding Artificial Intelligence</h2> 
<br>When some people hear the term artificial intelligence, the primary thing they usually think of is robots. Due to big-budget movies and books around human-like machines that wreak devastation on Earth. But nothing might be further from the truth.</br>

 <br>Artificial intelligence is based on the guideline that human intelligence can be characterized in a way that a machine can effortlessly mimic it and execute tasks, from the foremost straightforward to those that are indeed more complex. The objectives of artificial intelligence include learning, thinking, and perception.</br>

 <br>As technology progresses, previous benchmarks that characterized artificial intelligence gotten to be outdated. For illustration, machines that calculate essential functions or recognize text through ideal character recognition are not considered to embody artificial intelligence, since this function is presently taken for granted as an inherent computer work.</br>
<br>AI is continuously advancing to advantage numerous different industries. Machines are wired using a cross-disciplinary approach based in mathematics, computer science, linguistics, psychology, and etc.</br>
