<h1>The difference between Artificial and Human Intelligence</h1>
<br>Intelligence can be characterized as a common mental capacity for thinking, problem-solving, and learning. Since of its common nature, intelligence integrates cognitive capacities such as recognition, consideration, memory, language, or planning. On the basis of this definition, intelligence can be dependably measured by standardized tests with obtained scores predicting a few wide social results such as educational accomplishment, job performance, health, and life span. So letâ€™s study the differences between Artificial Intelligence and Human Intelligence in detail.</br>
